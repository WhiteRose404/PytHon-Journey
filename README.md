# PytHon-Journey
Python Journey is a simple, straight-forward programming course 👨‍💻 that will help you become comfortable programming in Python 3 🐍 and Beyond 🚀. This course built while i was studying for the python exam, since we didnt have a structure document for the course 💩, so this course was intended for me and my collegs at ENSIAS to help them pass with great success 🎉,
